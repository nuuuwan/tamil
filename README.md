# Learning Tamil

I’ve tried learning Tamil as an adult, with mixed results.

My main stumbling block is that I didn’t learn Tamil the way a native speaker would, that is, as a language standing on its own. Instead, I learnt it *via* Sinhala and English. Every Tamil word was mapped to a Sinhala or English equivalent, so inside my head Tamil became a kind of second-hand language.

I’ve been experimenting with different tools to get around this problem.

This is my latest attempt. It’s a simple, vibe-coded app where you guess the meaning of a Tamil word from a picture. No other languages. Just images that try to convey meaning directly.

Very much a work in progress. Feedback welcome.
